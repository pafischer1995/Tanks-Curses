# WELCOME TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF TANKS!!!!!!

## DESIGNED BY PAUL FISCHER AND DON JERVIS

In this game, you'll be able to command powerful tanks and wage war against your friends!
You'll have the ability to move and shoot at the enemy tank in an attempt to destroy it before it destroys you.
You have the ability to decide things like your name, how much health each tank will have for the fight, and even the color of your war machine!

#COMBAT

Each player will use the arrow keys to change the power and angle of their shot, trying to land their bullet right on the enemies tank.

Be careful, you can shoot yourself on mistake. 

Using the WASD keys will allow you to move your tank across the battlefield, granted you have enough fuel. 
Every turn you'll get an additional unit of fuel to try to avoid the enemies attacks.

*NOW TAKE YOUR PLACE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND DESTROY YOUR ENEMY!*
